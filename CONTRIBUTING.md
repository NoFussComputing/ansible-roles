# Contribution Guide


General workflow:
1. Fork repo
1. Setup [mirrored repo](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/12/01/how-to-keep-your-fork-up-to-date-with-its-origin/) *optional*
1. Create new branch using source branch `development`
1. Create Merge Request to source repo branch `development` branch from your new-branch *mark to remove branch on merge*
1. Start contributing.


|  :exclamation: **Tip** |
|:-----|
| *keep your forked repo up to date by setting up mirroring `Repository Settings -> Mirroring repositories`. Then setup to pull only protect branches.* |


> to setup the dev environment run `. ./develop.sh` from the root of the reository. This command creates a python virtual environment on which you can work from. `cz commit` is also available so that you can always commit with correctly formated commit messages.
